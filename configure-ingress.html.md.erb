This topic provides resources for configuring an ingress controller on <%= vars.product_full %>.

For information about configuring an ingress controller using NSX-T, see [Configuring Ingress Resources and Load Balancer Services](nsxt-ingress-srvc-lb.html).

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

In Kubernetes, an ingress is an API object that manages external access to the
services in a cluster. You can use ingress rules to provide HTTP or HTTPS routes
to services within the cluster instead of creating a load balancer. For more information, see [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) in the Kubernetes documentation.

The cluster must have an ingress controller running. You define ingress resource
configuration in the manifest of your Kubernetes deployment, and then use wildcard
DNS entries to route traffic to the exposed ingress resource.

To configure an ingress controller, you must do the following:

1. [Deploy a Kubernetes Ingress Controller](#deploy)
1. [Configure DNS](#dns)
1. (Optional) [Configure TLS](#tls)
1. [Deploy an App to the Cluster](#app)

## <a id='prerequisites'></a>Prerequisites

Before you configure an ingress controller, you must have the following:

- A PKS-deployed cluster with its own load balancer. See [Creating Clusters](create-cluster.html).
- A wildcard DNS record that points to the cluster load balancer.

## <a id='deploy'></a>Deploy a Kubernetes Ingress Controller

You can deploy an ingress controller of your choice to your Kubernetes cluster.
For a list of ingress controllers that Kubernetes supports, see [Ingress Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/) in the Kubernetes documentation.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: For information about configuring an ingress controller using NGINX on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP), see <a href="https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/how-to-set-up-an-ingress-controller-for-a-pks-cluster">How to set up an Ingress Controller for a PKS cluster</a> in the Pivotal Knowledge Base.</p>

To deploy an open source ingress controller to a PKS cluster, do the following:

1. Set the kubectl context for the cluster where you want to deploy the ingress controller by running the following command:

    ```
    pks get-credentials CLUSTER-NAME
    ```
    Where `CLUSTER-NAME` is the name of your PKS-deployed Kubernetes cluster.
    </br>
    </br> 
    For example: 

    <pre class="terminal">$ pks get-credentials pks-example-cluster

    Fetching credentials for cluster pks-example-cluster.
    Context set for cluster pks-example-cluster.

    You can now switch between clusters by using:
    $kubectl config use-context &ltcluster-name&gt
    </pre>
    
    <%= partial "saml-sso-login" %>

1. Verify that KubeDNS is enabled for your cluster by running the following command:

    ```
    kubectl cluster-info
    ```

    If KubeDNS is enabled, the output lists the URL for the KubeDNS service in the cluster. For example:
    <pre class="terminal">$ kubectl cluster-info
    Kubernetes master is running at https\://104.197.5.247
    elasticsearch-logging is running at https\://104.197.5.247/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/elasticsearch-logging/proxy
    kibana-logging is running at https\://104.197.5.247/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kibana-logging/proxy
    kube-dns is running at https\://104.197.5.247/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns/proxy
    grafana is running at https\://104.197.5.247/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/monitoring-grafana/proxy
    heapster is running at https\://104.197.5.247/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/monitoring-heapster/proxy
    </pre>
    If KubeDNS is not enabled, do the following:
    1. Navigate to Ops Manager and click the **BOSH Director** tile.
    1. Click the **Director Config** pane.
    1. Select the **Enable Post Deploy Scripts** checkbox.
    1. Click **Review Pending Changes**, and then **Apply Changes**.
    1. Delete the cluster, and then re-create the cluster.

1. Follow the installation instructions for the Kubernetes ingress controller
you choose to deploy. For example, see the installation guide in the [Istio](https://istio.io/docs/setup/kubernetes/install/) documentation.

## <a id='dns'></a>Configure DNS

After you deploy an ingress controller to your cluster, locate the HTTP port
number that the ingress rules expose. Configure DNS to point to the exposed port
on your Kubernetes worker node VMs.

To configure DNS for your cluster, do the following:

1. Run `kubectl get services` in the namespace where you deployed the ingress
controller. For example, if you deployed Istio, run the following command:

    ```
    kubectl  --namespace=istio-system get services
    ```
    In the output of this command, locate the exposed HTTP port.<br><br>
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">$ kubectl --namespace=istio-system get services
    NAME           TYPE            CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)
    istio-ingress  LoadBalancer    10.100.200.200   &lt;pending&gt;       80:30822/TCP,443:31441/TCP
    </pre>
    In the example above, the exposed HTTP port is 30822.

1. List the IP addresses for the Kubernetes worker node VMs by running the following command:

    ```
    kubectl -o jsonpath='{.items[*].status.addresses[0].address}' get nodes
    ```

1. Configure your load balancer to point to the Kubernetes worker node VMs,
using the IP addresses you located in the previous step and the exposed port
number you located in the first step.

## <a id='tls'></a>(Optional) Configure TLS

Enable Transport Layer Security (TLS) for the domain you configured for the cluster.

To configure TLS, do the following:

1. (Optional) Run the following command to generate a self-signed certificate:

    ```
    openssl req -x509 \
      -nodes -newkey rsa:4096 \
      -keyout KEY-PATH.pem \
      -out CERT-PATH.pem \
      -days 365 \
      -subj "/CN=*.PKS.EXAMPLE.COM"
    ```
    Where:
    - `KEY-PATH.pem` is the file path for the key you are generating.
    - `CERT-PATH.pem` is the file path for the certificate you are generating.
    - `*.PKS.EXAMPLE.COM` is the wildcard domain you configured in [Configure DNS](#dns).

1. Upload your TLS certificate and key to your ingress controller namespace by
running the following command:

    ```
    kubectl -n INGRESS-NAMESPACE create secret tls INGRESS-CERT \
    --key KEY-PATH.pem --cert CERT-PATH.pem
    ```
    Where:
    - `INGRESS-CERT` is a name you provide for the Kubernetes secret that contains
    your TLS certificate and key pair.
    - `KEY-PATH.pem` is the file path for your TLS key.
    - `CERT-PATH.pem` is the file path for your TLS certificate.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ kubectl -n istio-system create secret tls istio-ingress-certs \
    --key /tmp/tls.key --cert /tmp/tls.crt
    </pre>

## <a id='app'></a>Deploy an App to the Cluster

When your cluster has an ingress controller running and DNS configured, you can
deploy an app to the cluster that uses the ingress rules.

To deploy an app that uses ingress rules, do the following:

1. Deploy your app manifest by running the following command:

    ```
    kubectl create -f YOUR-APP.yml
    ```
    Where `YOUR-APP.yml` is the file path for your app manifest.

1. In the app manifest for your ingress controller, change the value of the `host:`
property to match the wildcard domain you configured in [Configure DNS](#dns) above.

1. Deploy your ingress controller app manifest by running the following command:

    ```
    kubectl create -f YOUR-APP.yml
    ```
    Where `INGRESS-CONTROLLER.yml` is the file path for your ingress controller app manifest.

1. Navigate to the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) you defined in your app manifest and confirm that you can access your app workload.

1. (Optional) If you configured TLS, do the following:

    1. Add the following to your ingress controller manifest to enable TLS:

        ```
        spec:
          tls:
            - secretName: INGRESS-CERT
          rules:
          - host: INGRESS.PKS.EXAMPLE.COM
        ```
        Where:
        - `INGRESS-CERT` is the name of the Kubernetes secret that contains your TLS
        certificate and key pair.
        - `INGRESS.PKS.EXAMPLE.COM` is the domain you defined for your app in the app manifest.

    1. Redeploy the ingress controller manifest to update the ingress service by
    running the following command:

        ```
        kubectl replace -f INGRESS-CONTROLLER.yml
        ```
        Where `INGRESS-CONTROLLER.yml` is the file path for your ingress controller app manifest.<br><br>

    1. Navigate to the FQDN you defined in your app manifest and confirm that you can access your app workload.
