This topic describes how to install and configure <%= vars.product_full %> on Azure.

##<a id='prerequisites'></a>Prerequisites

Before performing the procedures in this topic, you must have deployed and configured Ops Manager.
For more information, see [Azure Prerequisites and Resource Requirements](azure-requirements.html).

##<a id='install'></a> Step 1: Install <%= vars.product_short %>

<%= partial 'install-pks' %>

##<a id='configure'></a> Step 2: Configure <%= vars.product_short %>

Click the orange **<%= vars.product_tile %>** tile to start the configuration process.

  <p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: When you configure the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile.
  do not use spaces in any field entries. This includes spaces between characters as well as
  leading and trailing spaces. If you use a space in any field entry, the deployment of <%= vars.product_short %> fails.</p>

###<a id='cloud-provider'></a> Kubernetes Cloud Provider

To configure your Kubernetes cloud provider settings, follow the procedures below:

1. Click **Kubernetes Cloud Provider**.

1. Under **Choose your IaaS**, select **Azure**.

    <img src="images/cloud-azure.png" alt="Azure pane configuration">

1. Under **Azure Cloud Name**, select the identifier of your Azure environment.

1. Enter **Subscription ID**. This is the ID of the Azure subscription that the cluster is deployed in.

1. Enter **Tenant ID**. This is the Azure Active Directory (AAD) tenant ID for the subscription that the cluster is deployed in.

1. Enter **Location**. This is the location of the resource group that the cluster is deployed in.
<br><br>
	You set the location name in the `terraform.tfvars` file in [Deploying Ops Manager to Azure Using Terraform](https://docs.pivotal.io/pcf/om/azure/prepare-env-terraform.html). However, Terraform removes the spaces from this name and makes it lower-case. For example, if you entered `Central US` in the `terraform.tfvars` file, it becomes `centralus`. You must enter the converted form of the location name in the **Location** field, such as `centralus`.

1. Enter **Resource Group**. This is the name of the resource group that the cluster is deployed in.

1. Enter **Virtual Network**. This is the name of the virtual network that the cluster is deployed in.

1. Enter **Virtual Network Resource Group**. This is the name of the resource group that the virtual network is deployed in.

1. Enter **Default Security Group**. This is the name of the security group attached to the cluster's subnet.
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> <%= vars.product_short %> automatically assigns the default security group to each VM when you create a Kubernetes cluster.
However, on Azure this automatic assignment may not occur. For more information, see <a href="release-notes.html#security-group">Azure Default Security Group Is Not Automatically Assigned to Cluster VMs</a> in <em><%= vars.product_short %> Release Notes</em>.</p>

1. Enter **Primary Availability Set**. This is the name of the availability set that will be used as the load balancer back end.
<br><br>
	Terraform creates this availability set and its name is `YOUR-ENVIRONMENT-NAME-pks-as`, where `YOUR-ENVIRONMENT-NAME` is the value you provided for `env_name` in the `terraform.tfvars` file. See [Step 1: Download and Edit the Terraform Variables File](https://docs.pivotal.io/pcf/om/azure/prepare-env-terraform.html) of <em>Deploying Ops Manager to Azure Using Terraform</em> for more information. You can also find the name of the availability set by logging in to the Azure console.

1. For **Master Managed Identity**, enter `pks-master`. You created the managed identity for the master nodes in
[Create the Master Nodes Managed Identity](azure-managed-identities.html#create-master) in *Creating Managed Identities in Azure for <%= vars.product_short %>*.

1. For **Worker Managed Identity**, enter `pks-worker`. You created the managed identity for the worker nodes in
[Create the Worker Nodes Managed Identity](azure-managed-identities.html#create-worker) in *Creating Managed Identities in Azure for <%= vars.product_short %>*.

1. Click **Save**.

###<a id='syslog'></a> (Optional) Logging

<%= partial 'logging' %>

###<a id='networking'></a> Networking

To configure networking, do the following:

1. Click **Networking**.
1. Under **Container Networking Interface**, select **Flannel**.
  <img src="images/networking-flannel.png" alt="Networking pane configuration" width="425">
1. (Optional) Enter values for **Kubernetes Pod Network CIDR Range** and **Kubernetes Service Network CIDR Range**.
	* Ensure that the CIDR ranges do not overlap and have sufficient space for your deployed services.
	* Ensure that the CIDR range for the **Kubernetes Pod Network CIDR Range** is large enough to accommodate the expected maximum number of pods.
1. Under **Allow outbound internet access from Kubernetes cluster vms (IaaS-dependent)**, leave the **Enable outbound internet access** checkbox unselected. You must leave this checkbox unselected due to an incompatibility between the public dynamic IPs provided by BOSH and load balancers on Azure.

1. Click **Save**.

###<a id='uaa'></a> UAA

###<a id='monitoring'></a> (Optional) Monitoring

<%= partial 'monitoring' %>

###<a id='telemetry'></a> CEIP and Telemetry

<%= partial 'usage-data' %>

###<a id='errands'></a> Errands

<%= partial 'errands' %>

###<a id='resource-config'></a> Resource Config

To modify the resource usage of <%= vars.product_short %> and specify your PKS API load balancer, follow the steps below:

1. Select **Resource Config**.
    ![Resource pane configuration](images/azure-resources.png)
1. In the **Load Balancers** column, enter the name of your PKS API load balancer.
The name of your PKS API load balancer is `YOUR-ENVIRONMENT-NAME-pks-lb`. Refer to
the environment name you configured in your `terraform.tfstate` file during [Step 1: Download
Templates and Edit Variables File](https://docs.pivotal.io/pcf/om/azure/prepare-env-terraform.html). Then, append `-pks-lb` to that environment name.
  <%= partial 'lb-resource-config' %>

1. (Optional) Edit other resources used by the **PKS API** job.
The **PKS API** job requires a VM with the following minimum
resources:  
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>CPU</th>
      <th>Memory</th>
      <th>Disk</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>8&nbsp;GB</td>
      <td>29&nbsp;GB</td>
    </tr>
  </table>  
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The automatic <b>VM Type</b> value matches the minimum recommended size for the <b>Pivotal Container Service</b> job. 
      If you experience timeouts or slowness when interacting with the PKS API, select a <strong>VM Type</strong> with greater CPU and memory resources.  
  </p>
1. (Optional) If you do not use a NAT instance, select **Internet Connected** to allow component instances direct access to the internet.  

##<a id='apply-changes'></a> Step 3: Apply Changes

##<a id='retrieve-pks-api'></a> Step 4: Retrieve the PKS API Endpoint

<%= partial 'share-endpoint' %>

## <a id='lb-pks-api'></a> Step 5: Configure an Azure Load Balancer for the PKS API

Follow the procedures in [Configuring an Azure Load Balancer for the PKS API](azure-api-load-balancer.html) to configure an Azure load balancer for the PKS API.

## <a id='clis'></a> Step 6: Install the PKS and Kubernetes CLIs

<%= partial 'install-cli' %>

## <a id='auth'></a> Step 7: Configure Authentication for <%= vars.product_short %>

Follow the procedures in [Setting Up <%= vars.product_short %> Admin Users on Azure](azure-configure-pks-users.html).

##<a id='next-steps'></a> Next Steps

After installing <%= vars.product_short %> on Azure, you may want to do one or more of the following:

* Create a load balancer for your <%= vars.product_short %> clusters. For more information, see [Creating and Configuring an Azure Load Balancer for <%= vars.product_short %> Clusters](azure-cluster-load-balancer.html).
* Create your first <%= vars.product_short %> cluster. For more information, see [Creating Clusters](create-cluster.html).
