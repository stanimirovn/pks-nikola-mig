<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to deploy the VMware <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console appliance from the OVA template.

If you have deployed a previous version of <%= vars.product_full %> Management Console, you can also use the management console to upgrade it to a newer version.

## <a id='prereqs'></a>Prerequisites

- Download the OVA template from https://downloads.vmware.com.
- Use an account with vSphere administrator privileges to log in to vSphere using the vSphere Client.

## <a id='deploy-ova'></a>Step 1: Deploy the OVA Template

To deploy the <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console appliance to vSphere, the procedure is as follows:

1. In the vSphere Client, right-click an object in the vCenter Server inventory, select **Deploy OVF template**, and navigate to your download of the OVA template.
1. Follow the installer prompts to perform basic configuration of the appliance and to select the vSphere resources for it to use. 
  * Accept or modify the appliance name
  * Select the destination datacenter or folder
  * Select the destination cluster or resource pool for the appliance VM
  * Accept the end user license agreements (EULA)
  * Select the disk format and destination datastore for the appliance VM
1. On the **Select Networks** page, select a network port group to which to connect the appliance.
1. On the **Customize template** page, expand **Appliance Configuration**.
  * Set the root password for the appliance VM. Setting the root password for the appliance is mandatory.
  * Optionally uncheck the **Permit Root Login** checkbox.
  
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you uncheck the checkbox, you can permit root login later by editing the settings of the appliance VM.

1. Configure the appliance certificate, that is used by all of the services that run in the appliance to authenticate connections.
<br>
To use auto-generated, self-signed certificates, leave the **Appliance TLS Certificate**, **Appliance TLS Certificate Key**, and **Certificate Authority Certificate** text boxes blank. 
<br>
To use a custom certificate:
    1. Paste the contents of the server certificate PEM file in the **Appliance TLS Certificate** text box.

    ```
	-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    appliance_certificate_contents
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    ```   
    1. Paste the contents of the certificate key in the **Appliance TLS Certificate Key** text box. The appliance supports unencrypted PEM encoded formats for TLS private keys.

    ```
	-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
    appliance_private_key_contents
    -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
    ```    
    1. Paste the contents of the Certificate Authority (CA) file in the **Certificate Authority Certificate** text box.

    ```
	-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- 
    root_CA_certificate_contents 
    -----END CERTIFICATE----- 
    ```    
    To use a certificate that uses a chain of intermediate CAs, paste into the **Certificate Authority Certificate** text box the contents of a certificate chain PEM file. The PEM file must include a chain of the intermediate CAs all the way down to the root CA.

    ```
	-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    intermediate_CA_certificate_contents
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    intermediate_CA_certificate_contents
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    root_CA_certificate_contents
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    ```    
1. Expand **Networking Properties** and optionally configure the networking for the appliance VM.  
<br>
 To use DHCP, leave these properties blank.   
   * To set a static IP address on the appliance, set the **Network IP Address**, **Network Netmask**, and **Default Gateway** settings. 
   * To configure DNS servers, set the **Domain Name Servers**, and **Domain Search Path** settings. 
   * To specify a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for the appliance, set the **FQDN** setting.
1. Optionally enter the host name and port for VMware vRealize Log Insight in the **Log Insight Server Host/IP** and **Log Insight Server Port** text boxes.
<br>vRealize Log Insight gathers logs from the <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console appliance itself. For vRealize Log Insight to gather logs from your <%= vars.product_short %> deployments, you must configure the connection when you deploy <%= vars.product_short %> from <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console.
1. Click **Next** to review the settings that you have made.
1. Click **Finish** to deploy the <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console appliance.

Use the Recent Tasks panel at the bottom of the vSphere Client to check the status of the OVA import and deployment of the appliance VM. The appliance VM takes a few minutes to deploy.

If the appliance VM fails to deploy, see [Troubleshooting](console-troubleshooting.html).

## <a id='access-console'></a>Step 2: Log In to <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console

When the OVA deployment has completed successfully, you can access the management console.

1. In the vSphere Client, right-click the appliance VM and select **Power** > **Power On**.
1. When the appliance VM has booted, go to the **Summary** tab for the VM and  copy its IP address.
1. Enter the appliance IP address in a browser.
1. At the VMware <%= vars.product_short %> log in page, enter username `root` and the root password that you set when you deployed the OVA template. 

## <a id='next-step'></a> Next Step

You can now use <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console to deploy or upgrade <%= vars.product_short %> instances, either by using the configuration wizard or by importing an existing YAML configuration file.
