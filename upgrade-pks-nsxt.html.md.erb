<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic explains how to upgrade <%= vars.product_full %> for environments using vSphere with NSX-T.

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview

Refer to the [Release Notes](./release-notes.html) for the supported upgrade paths to <%= vars.product_short %> v1.5.0 and the supported Ops Manager versions.

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> Do not manually upgrade your Kubernetes version. <%= vars.product_short %> includes the compatible Kubernetes version.</p>

Before you begin the upgrade, follow the procedures in the [Prerequisites](#before) section to plan and prepare your upgrade.

After you complete the prerequisite steps, continue to the procedures in the [During the Upgrade](#upgrade) section. These steps guide you through the process of upgrading the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile, upgrading Ops Manager, importing an updated stemcell, and applying the changes to your deployment.

After you complete the upgrade, follow the procedures in the [After the Upgrade](#after-upgrade) section to verify that your upgraded <%= vars.product_short %> deployment is running properly.

## <a id="before"></a>Prerequisites

Before you upgrade <%= vars.product_short %>, you must do the following:

1. [Determine Your Upgrade Path](#upgrade-path)
1. [Prepare to Upgrade](#prepare)

### <a id="upgrade-path"></a> Determine Your Upgrade Path

    </ol>
  </td>
</tr>
</table>

### <a id="prepare"></a>Prepare to Upgrade

If you have not already, complete all of the steps in the
[Upgrade Preparation Checklist for <%= vars.product_short %> v1.5](./checklist.html).

## <a id="upgrade"></a> During the Upgrade

This section describes the steps required to upgrade to <%= vars.product_short %> v1.5:

1. [Upgrade to Ops Manager <%= vars.ops_man_version_2_5_short %> or <%= vars.ops_man_version_2_6_short %>](#upgrade-opsman)
1. [Upgrade to <%= vars.product_short %> v1.5](#upgrade-tile)
1. [Download and Import the Stemcell](#stemcell)
1. [Verify Errand Configuration](#errands)
1. [Apply Changes to the <%= vars.product_tile %> Tile](#apply-changes)

### <a id="upgrade-opsman"></a>Upgrade Ops Manager to <%= vars.ops_man_version_2_5_short %> or <%= vars.ops_man_version_2_6_short %>

Before you upgrade to <%= vars.product_short %> v1.5, you must upgrade to Ops Manager <%= vars.ops_man_version_2_5 %> or <%= vars.ops_man_version_2_6 %>.

To upgrade Ops Manager, do the following:

1. Complete the procedures in [Upgrade Ops Manager and Installed Products to v2.5](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-5/customizing/upgrading-pcf.html#upgrade_ops)
or [Upgrade Ops Manager and Installed Products to v2.6](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-6/customizing/upgrading-pcf.html#upgrade_ops).

1. <%= partial 'add-clusters-workloads' %>

### <a id="upgrade-tile"></a>Upgrade <%= vars.product_short %> to v1.5

To upgrade to <%= vars.product_short %> v1.5, follow the same Ops Manager process that you use to install the tile for the first time.

Your configuration settings migrate to the new version automatically. Follow the steps below to perform an upgrade.

1. Review the [Release Notes](release-notes.html) for the version you are upgrading to.

1. Download the desired version of the product from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-container-service/).

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product** to upload the product file.

1. Under the **Import a Product** button, click **+** next to **<%= vars.product_tile %>**. This adds the tile to your staging area.

### <a id="stemcell"></a>Download and Import the Stemcell

<%= vars.product_short %> v1.5 uses a [Xenial stemcell](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/stemcells/#xenial). 

If Ops Manager does not have the Xenial stemcell required for <%= vars.product_short %>, the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile displays the message **Missing stemcell**.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If the <b>Stemcell Library</b> in Ops Manager already has a compatible Xenial stemcell,
  the <b>Missing stemcell</b> link does not appear. You do not need to download or import a new stemcell and can skip this step.</p>

To download and import a new Xenial stemcell, follow the steps below:

1. On the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile, click the **Missing stemcell** link.

    <img src="images/missing_stemcell.png" alt="Verify stemcell assignment">

1. In the **Stemcell Library**, locate the **<%= vars.product_tile %>** tile and note the required stemcell version.

1. Navigate to the [Stemcells for PCF (Ubuntu Xenial)](https://network.pivotal.io/products/stemcells-ubuntu-xenial/) page on Pivotal Network
and download the required stemcell version for your IaaS.

1. Return to the **Installation Dashboard** in Ops Manager and click **Stemcell Library**.

1. On the **Stemcell Library** page, click **Import Stemcell** and select the stemcell file you downloaded from Pivotal Network.

1. Select the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile and click **Apply Stemcell to Products**.

1. Verify that Ops Manager successfully applied the stemcell. The stemcell version you imported and applied appears in the **Staged** column for <%= vars.product_tile %>.

1. Select the **Installation Dashboard** link to return to the Installation Dashboard.

### <a id="errands"></a>Verify Errand Configuration

To verify that errands are configured correctly in the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile, do the following:

1. Click the newly-added **<%= vars.product_tile %>** tile.

1. Click **Errands**.

1. Under **Post-Deploy Errands**, configure **Upgrade all clusters errand**:
  * If you want to upgrade the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile and all your existing Kubernetes clusters simultaneously,
  verify that **Upgrade all clusters errand** is set to **Default (On)**.
  The errand upgrades a single Kubernetes cluster at a time.
  Upgrading <%= vars.product_short %>-deployed Kubernetes clusters can temporarily interrupt the service
  as described in [Service Interruptions](interruptions.html).
  * If you want to upgrade the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile only and
  then upgrade your existing Kubernetes clusters separately, disable **Upgrade all clusters errand**.
  For more information, see [Upgrading Clusters](upgrade-clusters.html).
  <p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> If you upgrade the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile
  or update your tile configuration, with <strong>Upgrade all clusters errand</strong> disabled,
  you must upgrade all your Kubernetes clusters before the next upgrade or configuration update.</p>

1. Under **Post-Deploy Errands**, set the **Run smoke tests** errand to **On**. The errand uses the <%= vars.product_short %> Command Line Interface (PKS CLI) to create a Kubernetes cluster and then delete it. If the creation or deletion fails, the errand fails and the installation of the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile is aborted.

1. Click **Save**.

1. Review the other configuration panes. Click **Save** on any panes where you make changes.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> When you upgrade <%= vars.product_short %>, you must place singleton jobs in the AZ you selected when you first installed the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile. You cannot move singleton jobs to another AZ.</p>

### <a id="apply-changes"></a>Apply Changes to the <%= vars.product_tile %> Tile

Perform the following steps to complete the upgrade of the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile:

1. Return to the **Installation Dashboard** in Ops Manager.

1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.
     For more information about this Ops Manager page, see
    [Reviewing Pending Product Changes](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/customizing/review-pending-changes.html).

1. Click **Apply Changes**.

1. (Optional) To monitor the progress of the **Upgrade all clusters errand** using the BOSH CLI, do the following:
      1. Log in to the BOSH Director by running `bosh -e MY-ENVIRONMENT log-in` from a VM that can access your <%= vars.product_short %> deployment. For more information, see [Managing <%= vars.product_short %> Deployments with BOSH](manage-deployments-bosh.html).
      1. Run `bosh -e MY-ENVIRONMENT tasks`.
      1. Locate the task number for the errand in the <strong>&#35;</strong> column of the BOSH output.
      1. Run `bosh task TASK-NUMBER`, replacing `TASK-NUMBER` with the task number you located in the previous step.

## <a id="after-upgrade"></a>After the Upgrade

After you complete the upgrade to <%= vars.product_short %> v1.5, complete the following verifications and upgrades:

- [Update PKS and Kubernetes CLIs](#update-clis)
- [Verify the Upgrade](#verify-upgrade)

### <a id="update-clis"></a>Update PKS and Kubernetes CLIs

Update the PKS and Kubernetes CLIs on any local machine
where you run commands that interact with your upgraded version of <%= vars.product_short %>.

To update your CLIs, download and re-install the PKS and Kubernetes CLI distributions
that are provided with <%= vars.product_short %> on Pivotal Network.

For more information about installing the CLIs, see the following topics:

* [Installing the PKS CLI](installing-pks-cli.html)

* [Installing the Kubernetes CLI](installing-kubectl-cli.html)

### <a id="verify-upgrade"></a>Verify the Upgrade

After you apply changes to the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile and the upgrade is complete, perform the following steps:

1. Verify that your Kubernetes environment is healthy. To verify the health of your Kubernetes environment, see [Verifying
Deployment Health](verify-health.html#k8s).

1. <%= partial 'add-clusters-workloads' %>

## <a id="upgrade-nsxt"></a> Upgrade NSX-T Data Center

Follow these instructions to upgrade NSX-T Data Center to the latest supported version. 

1. You cannot upgrade to the latest support NSX-T version until you have upgraded all Kubernetes clusters to the target PKS version. The workflow is as follows:
  - Upgrade the PKS tile from 1.4.1 or later to 1.5.
  - Upgrade all Kubernetes clusters to the latest NCP version (using the "Upgrade all clusters errand" or individually)
  - Upgrade to the latest NSX-T version (only after all Kubernetes clusters have been upgraded)

1. Upgrade NSX-T. See the [Release Notes](./release-notes.html) supported versions.  

1. Confirm that your vSphere v6.5 or v6.7 installation is on the supported version and patch for the NSX-T version you are upgrading to. 
  - Refer to the [VMware Product Interoperability Matrices](https://www.vmware.com/resources/compatibility/sim/interop_matrix.php#interop&175=&1=).
  - If necessary, update to the required vSphere version or patch before proceeding with the upgrade of NSX-T.

1. To perform the upgrade, refer to the [NSX-T Data Center Upgrade Guide](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/index.html) in the VMware documentation.

1. If you made any architectural changes to your NSX-T environment that affect Enterprise PKS, such as adding a [VIP address](./nsxt-install-mgmt-vip.html) or [load balancer](./nsxt-install-mgmt-lb.html) for the NSX-T Management Cluster, update the PKS and BOSH tile with the new information, specifically:

-  In the BOSH Director tile, select the **vCenter Configuration** tab and update the following:
  - The **NSX Address** field
  - The **NSX CA Cert** field
  - Save the BOSH tile changes.
  <img src="images/nsxt/nsx-upgrade/nsx_24_upgrade-08.png" alt="Update BOSH with VIP and Cert"> 

- In the PKS tile, select the **Networking** tab and update the following: 
  - The **NSX Manager hostname** field
  - The **NSX Manager CA Cert** field 
  - Save the PKS tile changes
  <img src="images/nsxt/nsx-upgrade/nsx_24_upgrade-09.png" alt="Update <%= vars.product_short %> with VIP and Cert"> 

1. If you made changes to the BOSH or PKS tiles:
  - Go to the **Installation Dashboard** in Ops Manager.
  - Click **Review Pending Changes.**
  - Expand the **Errands** list for <%= vars.product_short %>.
  - Ensure that the **Upgrade all clusters errand** is selected.
  - Click **Apply Changes**.
