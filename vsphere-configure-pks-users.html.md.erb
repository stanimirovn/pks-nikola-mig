title: Setting Up Enterprise PKS Admin Users on vSphere
owner: PKS
iaas: vSphere
---

This topic describes how to create admin users in <%= vars.product_full %> with User Account and Authentication (UAA).
Creating at least one admin user is a necessary step during the initial set up of <%= vars.product_short %>.

## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

UAA is the identity management service for Pivotal Cloud Foundry. 
<%= vars.product_short %> includes a UAA server, which is hosted on the PKS control plane VM.

To interact with the UAA server, you can use the UAA Command Line Interface (UAAC).
You can either run UAAC commands from the Ops Manager VM or install UAAC on your local workstation.

## <a id='prerequisites'></a> Prerequisites

Before setting up admin users for <%= vars.product_short %>, you must have one of the following:

* SSH access to the Ops Manager VM

* A machine that can connect to your PKS control plane VM

## <a id='connect'></a>Step 1: Connect to the PKS Control Plane VM

You can connect to the PKS control plane VM from the Ops Manager VM or from a different machine such as your local workstation.

### <a name='ssh-vsphere'></a>Option 1: Connect through the Ops Manager VM

You can connect to PKS control plane VM by logging in to the Ops Manager VM through SSH.
To SSH into the Ops Manager VM on vSphere, do the following:

To SSH into the Ops Manager VM on vSphere, you need the credentials used to import the PCF `.ova` or `.ovf` file into your virtualization system.
You set your credentials in the [Prepare vSphere](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/om/vsphere/deploy.html#deploy) section of _Deploying Ops Manager on vSphere_ for your Ops Manager version.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you lose your password, you must shut down the Ops Manager VM in the vSphere UI and reset the password. See <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.5/com.vmware.vsphere.security.doc/GUID-4BDBF79A-6C16-43B0-B0B1-637BF5516112.html">vCenter Password Requirements and Lockout Behavior</a> in the vSphere documentation for more information.</p>

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> If you deployed Ops Manager v2.6 on vSphere, you can only SSH into the Ops Manager VM with a private SSH key. If you do not have a private SSH key, you must add a public key to your <code>.ova</code> or <code>.ovf</code> file and then use the private key to SSH onto the Ops Manager VM. If you do not add a key, Ops Manager shuts down automatically because it cannot find a key and may enter a reboot loop.</p>

To SSH into the Ops Manager VM on vSphere, do one of the following:

+ **If you set a password when you installed Ops Manager:**
    1. SSH into the Ops Manager VM by running the following command:

        ```
        ssh ubuntu@OPS-MANAGER-FQDN
        ```
        Where `OPS-MANAGER-FQDN` is the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of Ops Manager. <br><br>
    1. When prompted, enter the password that you set during the `.ova` deployment
    into vCenter. For example:
      <pre class="terminal">$ ssh ubuntu&#64;my-opsmanager-fqdn.example.com
      Password: ***********
      </pre>
    1. Proceed to the [Log in as a UAA Admin](#uaa-admin-login) section to manage users with UAAC.
+ **If you set a SSH key when you installed Ops Manager:**
      1. Change the permissions for your private SSH key by running the following command:
          
          ```
          chmod 600 PRIVATE-KEY
          ```
          Where `PRIVATE-KEY` is the name of your private SSH key.<br><br>
      1. SSH into the Ops Manager VM by running the following command:

          ```
          ssh -i PRIVATE-KEY ubuntu@OPS-MANAGER-FQDN
          ```
          Where `OPS-MANAGER-FQDN` is the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of Ops Manager.
          
          For example:

          <pre class="terminal">$ ssh -i id_rsa ubuntu&#64;my-opsmanager-fqdn.example.com</pre>
      1. Proceed to the [Log In as a UAA Admin](#uaa-admin-login) section to create admin users with UAAC. 
      
### <a name='local-workstation'></a>Option 2: Connect through a Non-Ops Manager Machine

To connect to the PKS control plane VM and run UAA commands, do the following:

1. Install UAAC on your machine. For example:
  
    ```
    gem install cf-uaac
    ```
1. Download a copy of your Ops Manager root CA certificate to the machine. To download the certificate, do the following:

  1. In a web browser, navigate to the FQDN of Ops Manager and log in.
  1. In Ops Manager, navigate to **Settings** in the drop-down menu under your username.
  1. Click **Advanced Options**.
  1. On the **Advanced Options** configuration page, click **Download Root CA Cert**.
  1. Move the certificate to a secure location on your machine and record the path.

1. Proceed to the [Log In as a UAA Admin](#uaa-admin-login) section to create admin users with UAAC.

##<a id='uaa-admin-login'></a>Step 2: Log In as a UAA Admin

<%= partial 'uaa-admin-login' %>

##<a id='pks-access'></a>Step 3: Assign <%= vars.product_short %> Cluster Scopes

<%= partial 'pks-uaa-scopes' %>

Based on the needs of your deployment, perform one or more of the following procedures:

* To assign PKS cluster scopes to an individual user, see 
[Grant <%= vars.product_short %> Access to an Individual User](manage-users.html#uaa-user). 
 Follow this procedure if you selected **Internal UAA** when you configured **UAA** in the <%= vars.product_short %> tile. For more information, see [Installing <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere](installing-pks-vsphere.html#uaa).
* To assign PKS cluster scopes to an LDAP group, see [Grant <%= vars.product_short %> Access to an External LDAP Group](manage-users.html#external-group). Follow this procedure if you selected **LDAP Server** when you configured **UAA** in the <%= vars.product_short %> tile. For more information, see [Installing <%= vars.product_short %> PKS on vSphere](installing-pks-vsphere.html#uaa).
* To assign PKS cluster scopes to a client, see [Grant <%= vars.product_short %> Access to a Client](manage-users.html#uaa-client).

##<a id="next-steps"></a> Next Step

After you create admin users in <%= vars.product_short %>, the admin users can create and manage 
Kubernetes clusters in <%= vars.product_short %>. 
For more information, see [Managing Clusters](managing-clusters.html).
