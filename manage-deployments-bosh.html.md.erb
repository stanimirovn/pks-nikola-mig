This topic describes how to manage your <%= vars.product_full %>
deployment using BOSH.

## <a id='alias'></a>Set a BOSH Environment Alias

To set a BOSH alias for your <%= vars.product_short %> deployment environment, follow the steps below:

1. Gather credential and IP address information for your BOSH Director and SSH
into the Ops Manager VM. See [Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH
CLI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html) for
more information.
1. To create a BOSH alias for your <%= vars.product_short %> environment, run the following command:
  <pre>bosh alias-env ENVIRONMENT \
    -e BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
    --ca-cert /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate</pre>
  Where:
    * `ENVIRONMENT` is an alias of your choice. For example, `pks`.
    * `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` is the BOSH Director IP address you located in the
first step. For example, `10.0.0.3`.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">$ bosh alias-env pks -e 10.0.0.3 \
    --ca-cert /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate</pre>
1. To log in to the BOSH Director using the alias you set, run the following command:
  <pre>bosh -e ENVIRONMENT login</pre>

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e pks login</pre>
