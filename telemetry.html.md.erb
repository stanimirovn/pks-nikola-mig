This topic describes the VMware Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP)
and the Pivotal Telemetry Program (Telemetry) used in the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile.

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview

The CEIP and Telemetry program allow VMware and Pivotal to collect data from customer installations to improve your <%= vars.product_short %> experience.
Collecting data at scale enables us to identify patterns and alert you to warning signals in your <%= vars.product_short %> installation.

### <a id="participation"></a>Participation Levels

You can configure <%= vars.product_short %> to use one of the following CEIP and Telemetry participation levels:

+ **None:** This level disables data collection.

+ **Standard:** (Default) This level collects data anonymously. Your data is used to
inform the ongoing development of <%= vars.product_short %>.

+ **Enhanced:** This level enables VMware and Pivotal to warn you about
security vulnerabilities and potential issues with your software configurations.
For more information, see [Benefits of the Enhanced Participation Level](#benefits) below.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> <%= vars.product_short %> does not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) at either participation level.
For a list of the data <%= vars.product_short %> collects, see <a href="#data-dictionary">Data Dictionary</a>.</p>

For instructions on configuring CEIP and Telemetry participation, see the [Installing <%= vars.product_short %>](installing.html) topic for your IaaS.

### <a id="benefits"></a> Benefits of the Enhanced Participation Level

Benefits you receive with the Enhanced participation level include but are not limited to the following:

* **Usage data:** This gives you access to data about Kubernetes pod and cluster usage in your <%= vars.product_short %> installation.
* **Access to your telemetry data:** This gives you access to configuration and usage data about your <%= vars.product_short %> installation.
* **Proactive support:** This enables VMware and Pivotal to proactively warn you about unhealthy patterns.
* **Benchmarks:** This is your usage relative to the rest of the <%= vars.product_short %> user base.

The table below compares the Standard and Enhanced participation levels.

## <a id="system-components"></a> System Components

The CEIP and Telemetry programs use the following components to collect data:

+ **Telemetry Server:** This component runs on the PKS control plane. The server receives telemetry events from the PKS API and metrics from Telemetry agent pods. The server sends events and metrics to a data lake for archiving and analysis.

+ **Telemetry Agent Pod:** This component runs in each Kubernetes cluster as a deployment with one replica. Agent pods periodically poll the Kubernetes API for cluster metrics and send the metrics to the Telemetry server.

The following diagram shows how telemetry data flows through the system components:
