### Storage Requirements for Large Numbers of Pods

If you expect the cluster workload to run a large number of pods continuously, 
then increase the size of persistent disk storage allocated to the the Pivotal Container Service VM as follows:

Number of Pods | Storage (Persistent Disk) Requirement ^&#x2A; 
-------------|-----------------------
 1,000  pods | 20 GB 
 5,000  pods | 100 GB
 10,000 pods | 200 GB 
 50,000 pods | 1,000 GB
