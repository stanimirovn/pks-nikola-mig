Before using BBR you must perform the following steps:

* [Verify your BBR Version](#verify-bbr-version)  
* [Download the BBR SSH Credentials](#bbr-ssh-creds)  
* [Download the BOSH Director Credentials](#bosh-creds)  
* [Download the UAA Client Credentials](#cluster-creds)   
* [Retrieve the BOSH Director Address](#bosh-address)  
* [Download the Root CA Certificate](#root-ca-cert)

### <a id='verify-bbr-version'></a> Verify Your BBR Version

Before running BBR, you must verify that the installed version of BBR is compatible with your deployment's current <%= vars.product_short %> release.  

1. For your current <%= vars.product_short %> release's minimum version information, see the [<%= vars.product_short %> Release Notes](release-notes.html).  

1. To verify the currently installed BBR version, run the following command:

    ```
    bbr version  
    ```

If you do not have BBR installed, or your installed version does not meet the minimum version requirement, 
see [Installing BOSH Backup and Restore](bbr-install.html).  

### <a id='setup'></a> Collect Credentials and Account Information

Before you can use BBR to perform a backup or restore, you will need to collect accounts and credentials to authenticate into your jumpbox, BOSH Director, and Ops Manager.  

#### <a id='bbr-ssh-creds'></a> Download the BBR SSH Credentials

There are two ways to retrieve BOSH Director credentials:

* [Ops Manager Installation Dashboard](#bbr-ssh-creds-via-ui)

#### <a id='bbr-ssh-creds-via-api'></a> Ops Manager API

To retrieve your **Bbr Ssh Credentials** using the Ops Manager API, perform the following steps:

1. Obtain your UAA access token. For more information, 
see [Access the API](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/ops-man-api.html#access-api).
