You need to retrieve the PKS API endpoint to allow your organization to use the API to create, update, and delete Kubernetes clusters.

To retrieve the PKS API endpoint, do the following:

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager **Installation Dashboard**.
1. Click the **<%= vars.product_tile %>** tile.
1. Click the **Status** tab and locate the **PKS API** job. The IP address of the Pivotal Container Service job is the PKS API endpoint.
