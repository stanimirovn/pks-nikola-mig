This topic describes how to define network profiles for pod networks.

##<a name='custom-pods'></a> Custom Pod Networks

When you configure your NSX-T infrastructure for <%= vars.product_short %>, you must create a **Pods IP Block**.
For more information, see the [Plan IP Blocks](nsxt-prepare-env.html#plan-ip-blocks) section of _Planning, Preparing, and Configuring NSX-T for <%= vars.product_short %>_.

By default, this subnet is non-routable. When a Kubernetes cluster is deployed, each pod receives an IP address from the **Pods IP Block** you created. Because the pod IP addresses are non-routable, NSX-T creates a SNAT rule on the Tier-0 router to allow network egress from the pods. This configuration is shown in the diagram below:

You can use a network profile to override the global **Pods IP Block** that you specify in the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile with a custom IP block. To use a custom pods network, do the following after you deploy <%= vars.product_short %>:

1. Define a custom IP block in NSX-T. For more information, see [Creating NSX-T Objects for <%= vars.product_short %>](nsxt-create-objects.html).

2. Define a network profile that references the custom pods IP block.
For example, the following network profile defines non-routable pod addresses from two IP blocks:

```
{
    "description": "Network profile with two non-routable pod networks",
    "name": "non-routable-pod",
    "parameters": {
      "pod_ip_block_ids": [
        "ebe78a74-a5d5-4dde-ba76-9cf4067eee55",
        "ebe78a74-a5d5-4dde-ba76-9cf4067eee56"
      ]
    }
}
```

##<a id='pod-prefix'></a> Pod Subnet Prefix

Each time a Kubernetes namespace is created, a subnet from the pods IP block is allocated. The default size of the subnet carved from this block for such purposes is /24. For more information, see the [Pods IP Block](nsxt-prepare-env.html#pods-ip-block) section of _Planning, Preparing, and Configuring NSX-T for <%= vars.product_short %>_.

You can define a Network Profile using the `pod_subnet_prefix` parameter to customize the size of the pod subnet reserved for namespaces. For example, the following network profile specifies /27 for the size of the pods IP block subnet:

```
{
    "name": "np-pod-prefix",
    "description": "Network Profile for Customizing Pod Subnet Size",
    "parameters": {
        "pod_subnet_prefix" : 27
    }
}
```

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The subnet size for a Pods IP Block must be consistent across all Network Profiles.
<%= vars.product_short %> does not support variable subnet sizes for a given IP Block.</p>

##<a id='routable-pods'></a> Routable Pod Networks

Using a network profile, you can assign routable IP addresses from a dedicated routable IP block to pods in your Kubernetes cluster. When a cluster is deployed using that network profile, the routable IP block overrides the default non-routable IP block described created for deploying <%= vars.product_short %>. When you deploy a Kubernetes cluster using that network profile, each pod receives a routable IP address. This configuration is shown in the diagram below. If you use routable pods, the SNAT rule is not created.

To use routable pods, do the following after you deploy <%= vars.product_short %>:

1. Define a routable IP block in NSX-T. For more information, see [Creating NSX-T Objects for <%= vars.product_short %>](nsxt-create-objects.html).

2. Define a network profile that references the routable IP block.
For example, the following network profile defines routable pod addresses from two IP blocks:

```
{
    "description": "Network profile with small load balancer and two routable pod networks",
    "name": "small-routable-pod",
    "parameters": {
      "pod_routable": "true",
      "pod_ip_block_ids": [
        "ebe78a74-a5d5-4dde-ba76-9cf4067eee55",
        "ebe78a74-a5d5-4dde-ba76-9cf4067eee56"
      ]
    }
}
```
