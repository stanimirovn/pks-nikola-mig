By assigning PKS cluster scopes, you grant users the ability to create and manage Kubernetes clusters in <%= vars.product_short %>.

As a UAA admin user, you can assign the following UAA scopes:

  * `pks.clusters.manage`: Accounts with this scope can create and access their own clusters.
  * `pks.clusters.admin`: Accounts with this scope can create and access all clusters.

You can assign these scopes to individual users, external identity provider groups, or clients for automation purposes.
