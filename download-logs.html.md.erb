To download cluster logs, perform the following steps:

1. Gather credential and IP address information for your BOSH Director, SSH into the Ops Manager VM, and use the BOSH CLI v2+ to log in to the BOSH Director from the Ops Manager VM.
For more information, see [Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html).
1. After logging in to the BOSH Director, identify the name of your <%= vars.product_full %> deployment. For example:
  <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e pks deployments</pre>
  Your <%= vars.product_short %> deployment name begins with `pivotal-container-service` and includes a BOSH-generated hash.
1. Identify the names of the VMs you want to retrieve logs from by listing all VMs in your deployment. For example:
	<pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e pks -d pivotal-container-service-aa1234567bc8de9f0a1c vms</pre>
1. Download the logs from the VM. For example:
	<pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e pks \
  -d pivotal-container-service-aa1234567bc8de9f0a1c logs pks/0</pre>
	See the [View Log Files](diagnostic-tools.html#bosh-pks-map) section of the _Diagnostic Tools_ topic for information about using cluster logs to diagnose issues in your <%= vars.product_short %> deployment.
